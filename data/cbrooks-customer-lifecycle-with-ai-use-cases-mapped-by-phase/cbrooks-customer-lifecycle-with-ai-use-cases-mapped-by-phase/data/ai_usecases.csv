A. Acquisition,1. Awareness,Anti-Money Laundering,"AI, especially time series modeling, is particularly good at looking at series of complex transactions and finding anomalies. Anti-money laundering using machine learning techniques can find suspicious transactions and networks of transactions. These transactions are flagged for investigation and can be scored as high, medium or low priority so that the investigator can prioritize their efforts. The AI can also provide reason codes for the decision to flag the transaction. These reason code tell the investigator where they might look to uncover the issues and help to streamline the investigative process. AI can also learn from the investigators as they review and clear suspicious transactions and automatically reinforce the AI model’s understanding to avoid patterns that don’t lead to laundered money.
